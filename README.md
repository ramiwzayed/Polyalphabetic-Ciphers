# Polyalphabetic-Ciphers
A set of related monoalphabetic substitution rules is used 
A key determines which particular rule is chosen for a given transformation
# Rules Encrypt
1. Shift first letter three positions to its right
2. shift the second letter five positions to its right 
3. shift the third letter seven positions to its right 
# Rules Dencrypt
1. Shift first letter three positions to its left
2. shift the second letter five positions to its left 
3. shift the third letter seven positions to its left 


# Example 
Consider M = "Security"
#### First we Should write the numbers and letter below each other, then hold the letter with the number above letter.
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
A B C D E F G H I J  K  L  M  N  O  P  Q  R  S T  U
21 22 23 24 25
V   W  X  Y  Z
#### Encrypt Solution
M = SEC  URI  TY
S = VJJ  XWP   WD

**VJJXWPWD**
#### Dencrypt Solution
C = VJJ  XWP  WD
N = SEC  URI  TY

**SECURITY**
